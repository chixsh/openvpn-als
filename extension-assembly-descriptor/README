We need to use this custom assembly descriptor because the default "bin"
descriptor has too simplistic predefined behavior. The purpose of the
descriptor is to build an old-style SSL-Explorer/Adito extension bundle
until a more streamlined solution is ready.

Copy the pom-fragment.xml to each extension's pom.xml to make use of this
shared assembly. It ties the assembly creation to the standard maven2
lifecycle.
