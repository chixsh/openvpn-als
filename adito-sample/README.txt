1. Use the sample plugin to create the new wizard and pages. (both java and jspf)
2. Change all java files to the new name and fill in all the TODO's, remembering spellings
3. Add all Variables and all flows, but not the correct database entries..
4. Refactor the project into the main src tree if it is to reside there.
5. Add the entries in the tiles-defs and struts-config to the main 1's
6. Add the menue items to the main pages.
7. Add the css styles to the main 1's.
8. Update and overwrite the sample package so you can start again.
9. Now you can add the database back end.
10. This should now work.
