<p>Contains class for the default container implementation in which the OpenVPN-ALS
web applications runs.</p>

<p>OpenVPN-ALS is primarily a standard Java web application. However, it
requires a few additional services from the container that it is running in.  
This environment is called the {@link com.ovpnals.boot.Context} (see
this interfaces Javadoc for more information about this environment).</p>

<p>The current implementation of this Context is made up of classes contained 
in this package and makes use of :-
	<ul>
		<li>Jetty - As the servlet / JSP container required for struts and OpenVPN-ALS itself.</li>
		<li>HSQLDB - For the Database engine</li>
		<li>Wrapper - For service control and JVM resilience.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>Although this is the only implementation, it is envisaged that there may one
day be a requirement for OpenVPN-ALS to run on other platforms made up of components
other than those above. For example, in theory it should be possible for OpenVPN-ALS
to run using Tomcat for the servlet container and MySQL for the database.</p>

<p>In practice thought, there are still a few areas when Jetty code is used inside
the webapp itself, so a little more refactoring will be necessary.</p>
