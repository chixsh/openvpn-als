KNOW ISSUES / LIMITATIONS
-------------------------
All users are assignated to a same group, "Users".
User Database is built as the users try to log in :
	* The extension only checks credentitials
	* Due to PAM modules, all given username are supposed to exist.
	Therefore, the user unknow error is checked but I'm not able to test it.


INSTALLATION
------------

If you have a recent (rev. 171+) the SVN version of Adito, adito-community-pam is already included. If 
you're using Adito 0.9.0, you need to download adito-community-pam first:

 $ cd $ADITO_HOME
 $ svn co https://adito.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/adito/adito/trunk/adito-community-pam

For more information about how to use Adito's SVN repository see

 http://adito.wiki.sourceforge.net/using_adito_svn

If you have clean, unused Adito source tree, you can use "ant adito-install" to first build 
adito-community-pam and then run the Adito installation wizard. If you just want to build the module, use 
"ant install". Next you need to create a PAM configuration file for Adito and copy it to /etc/pam.d. This 
is easiest to do if you issue "ant install-pam-conf" as root, for example with:

 $ su -c "ant install-pam-conf"

or

 $ sudo ant install-pam-conf

You probably need to install the PAM configuration file before configuring PAM in the installation 
wizard.


BUILD TARGETS
-------------

install:

Compile, build a ZIP Extension, then copy it to adito repository.
It also copy usefull shared object library (libjpam.so) to Java lib directory. And JPam-1.0.jar to adito/lib
Create a default PAM Service into /etc/pam.d - adito - using unix auth.

adito-install:

Install then call "install" target on adito default ant script.

uninstall:

Remove copied files.
