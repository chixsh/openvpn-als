This plugin is essentially the SSL-Explorer PAM module converted for Adito.
See https://sourceforge.net/search/?type_of_search=soft&words=sslexplorer-pam
for the original code.

**********************
*** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
**********************

Currently adito-community-pam is not usable. The original
sslexplorer-community-pam was written for an older SSL-Explorer version than
the one Adito is based on. The authentication module API changed after
SSL-Explorer PAM's release and it does not implement all the required methods.
Reimplementing these should not be difficult, though.

In short, do not expect this module to build cleanly just yet.

version 0.1.0
-------------

REQUIREMENTS
------------
* UN*X Platform
* Adito 0.9 or a version from SVN
* Adito requirements (java 1.5+, ant 1.6+, etc.)
* PAM

INCLUDES
--------
* JPAM 1.0 built from trunk
* Apache Commons Logging
* Three simples pam configs


DEVELOPING/TESTING PLATFORM
----------------------------
* Ubuntu 6.06
  * kernel 2.6.15-28-686 (ubuntu)
  * java 1.5.06
  * ant 1.6.5


KNOW ISSUES / LIMITATIONS
-------------------------
All users are assignated to a same group, "Users".
User Database is built as the users try to log in :
	* The extension only checks credentitials
	* Due to PAM modules, all given username are supposed to exist.
	Therefore, the user unknow error is checked but I'm not able to test it.


DEALING WITH SOURCES
--------------------

First of all, download last Adito source package from Sourceforge.net, then extract it somewhere, /opt for
example.

Next extract the PAM plugin source to Adito root. If you use the SVN version of Adito, you already have
adito-community-pam directory in $ADITO_HOME. If not already done, open a shell and go into
adito-community-pam directory.

You can now use ant, with a specified target:

install:

Compile, build a ZIP Extension, then copy it to adito repository.
It also copy usefull shared object library (libjpam.so) to Java lib directory. And JPam-1.0.jar to adito/lib
Create a default PAM Service into /etc/pam.d - adito - using unix auth.

adito-install:

Install then call "install" target on adito default ant script.

uninstall:

Remove copied files.


So with a clean install you should do :


$ cd /opt/adito-0.9.0
$ cd adito-community-pam
$ ant install
$ cd ..
[... installing others extensions ...]
$ ant install
[... installing as service, start Adito ...]
