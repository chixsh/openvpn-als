v0.9.1 (19.12.2008):

Major new features:

* Nearly all existing SSL-Explorer applications have been converted to OpenVPN-ALS
* Extension Store available and enabled by default
* Source and binary releases
* Localization support using language module
* Finnish translation
* Most wrapper problems now fixed for good
* SSL-Explorer PAM converted to OpenVPN-ALS

Lots of fixes to build files:

* Building OpenVPN-ALS is much simpler and less error-prone
* Better SVN compatibility
* Building on Mac OS X (10.4/10.5) now works
* Moved most property definitions to a global build.properties-file
* Lots of other small improvements to the build files

Other changes:

* A couple of graphical fixes
* Removed most references to "Enterprise Edition"
* Removed some references to 3sp where appropriate
* Allowed use of longer username (e.g. email addresses)
* Added some SSL-Explorer -> OpenVPN-ALS conversion scripts to "tools" directory
* Lots and lots of documentation written to OpenVPN-ALS Wiki (http://openvpnals.wiki.sourceforge.net/)
* Lots of infrastructure and community building work


v0.9.0 (18.5.2008):

* Due to trademark issues all references to SSL-Explorer have been replaced with references to OpenVPN-ALS. This includes Java variable names.
* Most references to 3sp - with the exception of copyright notices - have been removed.
* User-interface icons, which 3sp had licensed from a third party have been replaced with freely distributable Tango icons and icons derived from them.
* OpenVPN-ALS Agent Java1 compilation has been disabled in $OpenVPN-ALS_HOME/agent/build.xml. Otherwise the building the OpenVPN-ALS Agent would fail.
* Fixed permission problems in $OpenVPN-ALS_HOME/openvpnals/install/platforms. The necessary files were not executable and thus starting OpenVPN-ALS would fail.
* Removed supportOptions.html.
