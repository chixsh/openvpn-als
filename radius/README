BUILDING RADIUS AUTHENTICATION PLUGIN

See ../README.nonembedded for generic instructions on how to build entire
"nonembedded" branch. RADIUS plugin will be built along with the other 
modules. 

Note - the required radiusAuth.jspf file is not yet (21st Aug 2009) in 
the SVN, but it's getting there.

INSTALLATION

This is how you install the RADIUS authentication module:

- stop adito
- drop the radius/target/radius-extension.zip to
  $ADITO_HOME/conf/repository/archives
- start adito
- login as admin
- create a new authentication scheme and attach RADIUS module to it
- put the RADIUS-enabled authentication scheme to the top of the list 
  (should you want that)
- edit RADIUS settings under "System Configuration -> RADIUS" (and possibly
  restart)

You might be able to just upload the radius-extension.zip using 
Extension Manager without stopping and starting Adito.
