The webapp/WEB-INF/jsp directory contained a JSP page, radiusAuth.jspf, which created the login page for
RADIUS users. However, this JSP page was directly taken from SSL-Explorer's proprietary
sslexplorer-enterprise-RADIUS extension. Using the JSP file would have violated Barracuda Network's
(formerly 3sp) copyright and put the project at an unnecessary risk. Other files were either taken from
the old sslexplorer-community-RADIUS plugin or otherwise safe to use.

So the current RADIUS authentication module is unusable due to missing login JSP page. Otherwise it
_should_ work properly.
