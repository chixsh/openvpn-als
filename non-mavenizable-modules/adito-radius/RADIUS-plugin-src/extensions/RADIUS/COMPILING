Compiling the RADIUS plugin from source
=======================================

Requirements
------------

Java Development Kit 1.5+ (5.0+)
Ant 1.6+ (Earlier versions may work)
SSL-Explorer 0.1.10

Procedure
---------

1. Change directory the unzipped extension archive.

   $ cd /opt/sslexplorer/webapp/applications/RADIUS
   
2. Unzip the source. You can unzip this anyway, but for this example
   we'll assume that you are just going to unzip and work in the
   RADIUS exension directory itself.

   $ unzip src.zip
   
3. Change directory to RADIUS-src

   $ cd RADIUS-src
   
4. The build script needs to know the location of SSL-Explorer,
   so first take a copy build.properties.sample to build.properties.
   
   $ cp build.properties.sample build.properties
   
5. Now edit this new file, changing sslexplorer.home to the location
   of your installed SSL-Explorer.
   
6. Now create the extension archive using Ant.

   $ ant
   
7. When the build has complete successfully, you will have a file
   in build/archives called RADIUS.zip. This can be installed into
   SSL-Explorer in the normal way.
